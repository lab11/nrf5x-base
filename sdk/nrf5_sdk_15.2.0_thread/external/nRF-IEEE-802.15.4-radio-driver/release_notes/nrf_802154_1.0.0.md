# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.0.0 release notes

Release date: 2018-03-12

This is the first official release of the nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver.

## New features:

* Reception of unicast and broadcast frames
* Automatic transmission of ACK frames
* Setting a pending bit in the ACK frame according to availability of pending data for the given destination
* Filtering of received frames (according to IEEE-802.15.4-2006 and partially 2015)
* Promiscuous mode
* Transmission of unicast and broadcast frames
* Automatic CCA procedure before transmission
* CSMA-CA procedure
* Automatic receiving of ACK frames
* Handling time-out of automatic receiving of ACK frames
* Stand-alone CCA procedure
* Low power mode (sleep)
* Energy detection
* Continuous carrier transmission (for radio testing)
* Dynamic multiprotocol support
* Front-end modules support
* Providing diagnostic information (i.e. CRC errors, received invalid frames, received frames with mismatching destination address)

Details and usage of each of the features is described:
* [Wiki](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/wiki)
* Public API documentation in the `nrf_802154.h` file.

## Limitations:
* In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.
