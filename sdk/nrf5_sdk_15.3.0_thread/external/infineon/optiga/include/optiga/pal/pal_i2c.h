/**
 * API to initialize the i2c master with the given context.
 * <br>
 *
 *<b>API Details:</b>
 * - The platform specific initialization of I2C master has to be implemented as part of this API, if required.<br>
 * - If the target platform does not demand explicit initialization of i2c master
 *   (Example: If the platform driver takes care of init after the reset), it would not be required to implement.<br>
 * - The implementation must take care the following scenarios depending upon the target platform selected.
 *   - The implementation must handle the acquiring and releasing of the I2C bus before initializing the I2C master to
 *     avoid interrupting the ongoing slave I2C transactions using the same I2C master.
 *   - If the I2C bus is in busy state, the API must not initialize and return #PAL_STATUS_I2C_BUSY status.
 *   - Repeated initialization must be taken care with respect to the platform requirements. (Example: Multiple users/applications
 *     sharing the same I2C master resource)
 *
 *<b>User Input:</b><br>
 * - The input #pal_i2c_t p_i2c_context must not be NULL.<br>
 *
 * \param[in] p_i2c_context   Pal i2c context to be initialized
 *
 * \retval  #PAL_STATUS_SUCCESS  Returns when the I2C master init it successfull
 * \retval  #PAL_STATUS_FAILURE  Returns when the I2C init fails.

/**
 * Platform abstraction layer API to set the bitrate/speed(KHz) of I2C master.
 * <br>
 *
 *<b>API Details:</b>
 * - Sets the bitrate of I2C master if the I2C bus is free, else it returns busy status #PAL_STATUS_I2C_BUSY<br>
 * - The bus is released after the setting the bitrate.<br>
 * - This API must take care of setting the bitrate to I2C master's maximum supported value.
 * - Eg. In XMC4500, the maximum supported bitrate is 400 KHz. If the supplied bitrate is greater than 400KHz, the API will
 *   set the I2C master's bitrate to 400KHz.
 * - Use the PAL_I2C_MASTER_MAX_BITRATE macro to specify the maximum supported bitrate value for the target platform.
 * - If upper_layer_event_handler is initialized, the upper layer handler is invoked with the respective event
 *   status listed below.
 *   - #PAL_I2C_EVENT_BUSY when I2C bus in busy state
 *   - #PAL_I2C_EVENT_ERROR when API fails to set the bit rate
 *   - #PAL_I2C_EVENT_SUCCESS when operation is successful

 * - The input #pal_i2c_t  p_i2c_context must not be NULL.<br>

 * \retval  #PAL_STATUS_FAILURE  Returns when the setting of bitrate fails.
 * \retval  #PAL_STATUS_I2C_BUSY Returns when the I2C bus is busy.

/**
 * Platform abstraction layer API to write the data to I2C slave.

 * - The API attempts to write if the I2C bus is free, else it returns busy status #PAL_STATUS_I2C_BUSY<br>
 * - The bus is released only after the completion of transmission or after completion of error handling.<br>
 * - The API invokes the upper layer handler with the respective event status as explained below.

 *   - #PAL_I2C_EVENT_ERROR when API fails
 *   - #PAL_I2C_EVENT_SUCCESS when operation is successfully completed asynchronously
 *<br>
 *
 *<b>User Input:</b><br>
 * - The input #pal_i2c_t p_i2c_context must not be NULL.<br>
 * - The upper_layer_event_handler must be initialized in the p_i2c_context before invoking the API.<br>
 *
 *<b>Notes:</b><br>
 *  - Otherwise the below implementation has to be updated to handle different bitrates based on the input context.<br>
 *  - The caller of this API must take care of the guard time based on the slave's requirement.<br>
