# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.2.0 release notes

Release date: 2018-08-20

This release contains a new major feature: delayed transmission. The driver can schedule one frame to transmit it at a requested time. It is used by higher-layer features like CSL, TSCH, or ZigBee GP Proxy. The release also includes fixes to bugs found since the last release.

Timestamps of received frames are improved in this release to make the delayed tranmission reliable. New platform abstraction of the high precision (HP) timer was introduced to enhance precision of timestamps.

## New features:
* New Radio Scheduler module resposible for radio preconditions management and delayed transmission scheduling.

## External dependencies changes:

## Limitations:
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* (inherited) In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.

## Known issues:
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid. Workaround: enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during transmission procedure works incorrectly. Workaround: enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* (inherited) Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
