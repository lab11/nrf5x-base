# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.2.3 release notes

Release date: 2018-12-20

This is a bugfix release that fixes problems found in the version 1.2.2 and contains refactoring of the RSCH module.
This release also includes an experimental version of the delayed RX feature. This feature is intended to be used by duty-cycling receivers like Zigbee Green Power, CSL, or TSCH devices.

## Bug fixes:
* Fixed a SoftDevice RAAL problem caused by clocks drift. ([PR #184](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/184))
* Improved protocol switching performance. ([PR #174](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/174), [PR #181](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/181))
* Fixed handling of invalid frames in the promiscuous mode. ([PR #176](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/176))
* Fixed logging in the SoftDevice RAAL module. ([PR #182](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/182))

## External dependencies changes:
* Updated SoftDevice headers and documentation to version S140 v6.1.1. Note that the 802.15.4 radio driver is compatible with SoftDevices S140 v5.0.0, v6.0.0, v6.1.0, and v6.1.1. ([PR #173](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/173))

## Build system updates:
* Added a code style checker based on uncrustify. ([PR #172](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/172))
* Enhanced on-target tests. ([PR #180](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/180), [PR #183](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/183))

## Experimental features:
* Delayed receive window. ([PR #169](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/169), [PR #170](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/170), [PR #175](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/175))

## Refactoring:
* Support for priority levels and an external arbiter in the RSCH module ([PR #168](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/168))
* Added a confirmation sent to the RAAL module informing that the ongoing timeslot has ended ([PR #178](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/178))

## Limitations:
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front end and the 802.15.4 front end:
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. The S140 SoftDevice v6.1.0 reserves PPI channels 17-31. Check definition of the `NRF_SOC_SD_PPI_CHANNELS_SD_ENABLED_MSK` macro in the `nrf_soc.h` file to verify the list of reserved PPI channels.
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues:
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid. Workaround: enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during transmission procedure works incorrectly. Workaround: enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
