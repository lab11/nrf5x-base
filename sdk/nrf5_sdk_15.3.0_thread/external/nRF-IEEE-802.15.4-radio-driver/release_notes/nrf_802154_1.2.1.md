# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.2.1 release notes

Release date: 2018-09-07

This release fixes build problems in some configurations and allows to run the driver with platforms that modify NVIC settings of the RTC used by the driver, which allows for managing critical sections.

## Bug fixes:
* Fix the build with CSMA-CA disabled. ([PR #154](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/154))
* RTC interrupt is now preserved while leaving critical sections. ([PR #155](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/155))


## Limitations:
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* (inherited) In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front-fnd and the 802.15.4 Front-End:
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice (17, 18, 19).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues:
* (inherited) If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid. Workaround: enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* (inherited) Deinitialization during transmission procedure works incorrectly. Workaround: enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* (inherited) Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
