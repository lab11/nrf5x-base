# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.2.2 release notes

Release date: 2018-10-22

This is a bugfix release that fixes problems found in the version 1.2.1.

## Bug fixes:
* Return success on transition requests to the rx state or the sleep state whenever applicable. ([PR #159](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/159))
* Changed the default configuration of the Front End module to not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. ([PR #160](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/160))
* Reduced the default timeout delay when receiving an Ack frame to avoid unnecessary retransmissions and lost frames. ([PR #161](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/161))
* Fixed the list of allowed transmission power values to match nRF52840 Rev 1 capabilities. ([PR #165](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/165))

## Limitations:
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front-fnd and the 802.15.4 Front End:
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. The S140 SoftDevice v6.1.0 reserves PPI channels 17-31. Check definition of the `NRF_SOC_SD_PPI_CHANNELS_SD_ENABLED_MSK` macro in the `nrf_soc.h` file to verify the list of reserved PPI channels.
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues:
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid. Workaround: enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during transmission procedure works incorrectly. Workaround: enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
