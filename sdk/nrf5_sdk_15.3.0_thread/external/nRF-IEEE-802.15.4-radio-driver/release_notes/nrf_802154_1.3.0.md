# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.3.0 release notes

Release date: 2019-02-04

This release offers support for a new chip: nRF52811. Additionally, it adds a parser and generator for Enhanced Acks. It also includes fixes to bugs that have been found since the last release.

## New features:
* Added a generator of Enhanced Acks and improved parsing of IEEE 802.15.4-2015 frames. ([PR #179](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/179))
* Provided support for a new chip: nRF52811. ([PR #190](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/190))
* Added a configuration option to delay CCA operations during the CSMA-CA procedure until a timeslot is granted by an arbiter. ([PR #191](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/191))

## Bug fixes:
* Timeslots are actively released when the higher layer requests a transition to the sleep state. Passive releasing of timeslots was found to be a source of failed operations. Operations were failing when the higher layer requested an operation a short time (less than 15 ms) after it requested a transition to the sleep state. ([PR #192](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/192), [PR #194](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/194), [PR #195](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/195))

## Limitations:
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front end and the 802.15.4 front end:
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. The S140 SoftDevice v6.1.0 reserves PPI channels 17-31. Check definition of the `NRF_SOC_SD_PPI_CHANNELS_SD_ENABLED_MSK` macro in the `nrf_soc.h` file to verify the list of reserved PPI channels.
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues:
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid. Workaround: enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during transmission procedure works incorrectly. Workaround: enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
