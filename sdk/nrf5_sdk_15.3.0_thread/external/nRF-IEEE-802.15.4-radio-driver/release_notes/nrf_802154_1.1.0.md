# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.1.0 release notes

Release date: 2018-04-04

This release contains new features to correct and calculate RSSI-related values (like LQI, Energy Detection result, CCA Energy Threshold). It also includes fixes to bugs found since the last release.

To correct RSSI-based values, a new platform abstraction for temperature measurement is provided (see `src/platform/temperature` directory). RSSI is corrected by a temperature-related factor.

## New features:
* Temperature measurement platform abstraction used to provide RSSI corrections. ([PR #87](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/87))
* Automatic correction of RSSI-based values. ([PR #87](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/87))
* Function to calculate CCA ED threshold from a given dBm value. ([PR #95](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/95))

## External dependencies changes:
* Updated SoftDevice headers and documentation to version s140 v6.0.0. Note that the 802.15.4 radio driver is compatible with SoftDevice s140 v5.0.0 and v6.0.0. ([PR #96](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/96))

## Bug fixes:
* CSMA-CA and Automatic RX ACK procedures notify errors even if they could not enter a critical section during notification. ([PR #91](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/91))
* Received frame is reported to the MAC layer when ACK transmission is terminated. ([PR #92](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/92))
* The driver core is correctly deinitialized with the Single-PHY RAAL. ([PR #100](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/100))
* Fixed IAR warnings with FEM enabled. ([PR #85](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/85), [PR #94](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/94))
* Fixed GCC warnings with NDEBUG compilation flag enabled. ([PR #88](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/88))
* Fixed GCC warnings with -Wunused-parameter flag enabled. ([PR #99](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/99))
* Prevented enabling RADIO IRQ in critical sections - source of race conditions. ([PR #86](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/86), [PR #90](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/90))
* Synchronized states in the driver core and the RAAL modules on timeslot exit - source of race conditions. ([PR #93](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/93), [PR #97](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/97), [PR #98](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/98))
* Changed order of setting states when new timeslot is requested in the SoftDevice RAAL module - source of race conditions. ([PR #101](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/101))

## Limitations:
* (inherited) In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.

## Known issues:
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
